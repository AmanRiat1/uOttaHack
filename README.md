# Form Rendering Examples

Hackathon project done by friends at the 2019 UOttawa Hackathon. 

Utilized an open source dataset regarding student's drinking habits to create multiple models that predict how at risk a student is to alcoholism. 

Models created using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and used whichever gave a higher accuracy.

Django utlized to give a simple web-based form submission.

Example used in the blog post [How to Render Django Form Manually](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/article/2017/08/19/how-to-render-django-form-manually.html)
